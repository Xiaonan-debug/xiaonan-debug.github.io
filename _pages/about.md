I am a first-year PhD student at the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) of the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/). I received my Bachelor's degree from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in **large language models**, **data-centric AI**, and **machine learning systems**, with a focus on:

- **Reasoning and Tool-Augmented Foundation Models**: explores how to endow foundation models with flexible, context-aware reasoning and the ability to orchestrate external tools and domain knowledge.
- **Data-Centric Optimization**: emphasizes data-centric methods for improving the reliability, robustness, and evaluability of AI systems.
- **Scientific AI**: studies how AI systems can accelerate scientific discovery in domains such as chemistry and the natural sciences.
- **Efficient AI Systems**: investigates systems and infrastructure that make modern AI models cheaper, faster, and more accessible in practice.

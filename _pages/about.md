I am a first-year PhD student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/). I received my Bachelor's degree from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning systems** and **efficient computing**. I am particularly interested in:

- **Large Language Models**: Enhancing reasoning capabilities and domain-specific intelligence in LLMs
- **ML Systems**: Designing efficient systems for machine learning workloads, including serverless computing architectures and GPU resource management
- **AI for Science**: Developing AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in chemistry and biomedical science

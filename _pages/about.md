I am a first-year PhD student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/). I received my Bachelor's degree from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning systems** and **efficient computing**. I am particularly interested in:

- **ML Systems**: Designing efficient systems for machine learning workloads, including serverless computing architectures and GPU resource management
- **Serverless Computing**: Developing low-latency, resource-efficient inference systems for deep learning models
- **Large Language Models**: Enhancing reasoning capabilities and domain-specific intelligence in LLMs
- **System Optimization**: Creating systems that balance performance, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness

My work focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical machine learning advances and practical system implementations, with emphasis on scalability and efficiency.
